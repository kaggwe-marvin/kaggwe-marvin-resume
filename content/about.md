## About Me

Hi, I'm **Kaggwe Marvin** - a passionate software developer based in Kampala, Uganda. I love building things that live on the internet and solving complex problems through code.

## My Journey

My journey into software development began with curiosity and has evolved into a deep passion for creating meaningful digital experiences. Currently, I'm working on the **Ordin project**, which has been instrumental in shaping my development philosophy and technical skills.

## What I Do

I specialize in **full-stack development** with a focus on:

- **Frontend Development**: Creating responsive, user-friendly interfaces
- **Backend Development**: Building robust APIs and server-side applications  
- **Database Design**: Structuring data for optimal performance
- **DevOps**: Streamlining development and deployment processes

## Technical Skills

### Languages & Frameworks

- **JavaScript/TypeScript** - React, Node.js, Express
- **Python** - Django, Flask, FastAPI
- **Go** - Building efficient backend services
- **HTML/CSS** - Semantic markup and modern styling

### Tools & Technologies

- **Git** - Version control and collaboration
- **Docker** - Containerization and deployment
- **PostgreSQL/MongoDB** - Database management
- **AWS/Digital Ocean** - Cloud infrastructure
- **Hugo** - Static site generation (like this site!)

## Current Focus

I'm currently deep into the **Ordin project**, where I'm applying modern development practices and exploring new technologies. This project has taught me valuable lessons about:

- Scalable architecture design
- User-centered development
- Performance optimization
- Collaborative workflows

## Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, you'll find me:

- **Learning**: Always exploring new technologies and development methodologies
- **Community**: Engaging with the local tech community in Kampala
- **Coffee**: Probably drinking way too much coffee while debugging
- **Reading**: Technical blogs, documentation, and the occasional non-tech book

## My Philosophy

I believe in writing code that is:

- **Clean and maintainable** - Future me (and my teammates) will thank me
- **User-focused** - Technology should solve real problems for real people
- **Continuously improved** - There's always a better way to do things

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in discussing new opportunities, collaborating on projects, or just chatting about technology. Whether you're looking for a developer, want to share ideas, or need advice on a project, feel free to reach out!
